# Selangor Flood Modelling

This is a compilation of the code needed to download data from NASA's Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) product for the State of Selangor, Malaysia and construct a machine learning model that can predict the probability of a flood in the given area.

This project is still heavily ongoing, thus please excuse how messy some of the code may be.
